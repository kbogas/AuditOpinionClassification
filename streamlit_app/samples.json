   "['Act of God (Extreme weather, War, Illness, Even Death, etc)', 'Notes Payable/Debt Maturity; Balance Due, Past-due, Default']": "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm<p>To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.<p>Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting<p>We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. and its subsidiaries (the \u0093Company\u0094) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of changes in shareholders\u0092 equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, including the related notes and financial statement schedule (not presented herein) listed in the index appearing under Item 15(2) of the Company\u0092s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K (collectively referred to as the \u0093consolidated financial statements\u0094). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).<p>In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.<p>Substantial Doubt About the Company\u0092s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern<p>The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has implemented a suspension of all cruise voyages for its three brands due to the continued spread of COVID-19, growing travel restrictions and limited access to ports around the world, and has debt maturities and other obligations coming due over the next year that raise substantial doubt about the Company\u0092s ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.<p>Change in Accounting Principle<p>As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019.<p>Basis for Opinions<p>The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management\u0092s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (not presented herein) appearing under Item 9A of the Company\u0092s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.<p>We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.<p>Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting<p>A company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u0092s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u0092s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.<p>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.<p>Critical Audit Matters<p>The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.<p>Ship Accounting - Improvement Costs<p>As described in Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company capitalized approximately $458.9 million of costs associated with ship improvements during 2019. As disclosed by management, ship improvement costs which add value to the ship are capitalized and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements\u0092 estimated useful lives or the remaining useful life of the ship.  The useful lives of ship improvements are estimated based on the economic lives of the new components. In addition, to determine the useful lives of the ship or ship components, management considers the impact of the historical useful lives of similar assets, manufacturer recommended lives and anticipated changes in technological conditions.  <p>The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to ship accounting - improvement costs is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management in determining whether costs associated with ship improvements add value to the Company\u0092s ships and in estimating the useful lives assigned. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to whether capitalization and useful lives assigned were appropriate.<p>F-2<p>Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to capitalization of ship improvements, including controls over the estimation of whether improvements add value to the ship and the useful lives assigned. These procedures also included, among others, testing the accuracy, existence/occurrence and valuation of capitalized ship improvement costs and evaluating whether costs capitalized add value to the ship. Evaluating the reasonableness of the useful lives assigned involved considering historical data and past experience with similar ship improvements. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the reasonableness of the assigned useful lives.<p>Goodwill Impairment Assessment - Oceania Cruises Reporting Unit<p>As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\u0092s goodwill balance for the Oceania Cruises reporting unit was $523.0 million as of December 31, 2019. Management reviews goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or earlier if there is an event or change in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be fully recoverable. For the 2019 annual goodwill impairment evaluation, management conducted a quantitative assessment comparing the fair value of the Oceania Cruises reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. This assessment consists of a combined approach using discounted future cash flows and market multiples to determine the fair value of the reporting units. The market approach considers revenue and EBITDA multiples from an appropriate peer group. The discounted cash flow valuation reflects management\u0092s principal assumptions related to (i) forecasted future operating results and growth rates, (ii) forecasted capital expenditures for fleet growth and ship improvements, and (iii) a weighted average cost of capital of market participants, adjusted for an optimal capital structure. Management believes that the combined approach is the most representative method to assess fair value as it utilizes expectations of long-term growth as well as current market conditions.<p>The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of the Oceania Cruises reporting unit is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management when developing the fair value of the reporting unit. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence relating to management\u0092s future cash flow projections and selected market multiples and the significant assumptions, including revenue and EBITDA multiples from an appropriate peer group, forecasted future operating results and growth rates, forecasted capital expenditures for fleet growth and ship improvements, and the weighted average cost of capital of market participants. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures.<p>Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\u0092s goodwill impairment assessment for Oceania Cruises, including controls over the valuation of the Company\u0092s reporting unit. These procedures also included, among others, testing management\u0092s process for developing the fair value estimate of the Oceania Cruises reporting unit; evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted future cash flow and market multiples approaches; testing the completeness, accuracy and relevance of underlying data used in the approaches; and evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management, including revenue and EBITDA multiples from an appropriate peer group, forecasted future operating results and growth rates, capital expenditures for fleet growth and ship improvements, and the weighted average cost of capital of market participants. Evaluating management\u0092s assumptions related to revenue and EBITDA multiples from an appropriate peer group, forecasted future operating results and growth rates, capital expenditures for fleet growth and ship improvements, and the weighted average cost of capital of market participants involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company\u0092s discounted future cash flow and market multiples approaches and certain significant assumptions, including the weighted average cost of capital of market participants.<p>F-3<p>/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP<p>Miami, Florida<p>February 27, 2020, except with respect to our opinion on the consolidated financial statements insofar as it relates to the matters that raise substantial doubt about the Company\u0092s ability to continue as a going concern discussed in Note 2 under Liquidity and Management\u0092s Plan, and the Events Subsequent to Original Issuance of Financial Statements discussed in Note 18, as to which the date is May 5, 2020<p>We have served as the Company\u0092s auditor since at least 1988.
